I actually made half of this project yesterday, but forgot to journal. I basically just made the schematic and placed/wired the switches up. Today, I wired the bare RP2040. WOW THAT WAS SO HARD BUT SO REWARDING. It took so many hours of completely starting from scratch, but eventually I got it. There are a lot of VIAs, but I think it will be fine. More detailed information in README, but here is my favorite image:
